# What is Lista DAO?

- Decentralized liquidity pool on BNB chain
- Earn yield from collateralized assets
- MakerDAO with modifications
- Dual token:
	* lisUSD: "destable" coin - a "new" type of stable coin
	* LISTA governance token, utility, not designed to be a "currency"

- Earn yield with 2 primary ways: liquidity staking and over-collateralized
debt positions.

# Why lista dao?

## Some defi:

- Destable coin lisUSD : [click me](https://github.com/lacklusterer/lsD-rsch/blob/main/README.md#destable-coin)
- Price stability: [click me](https://github.com/lacklusterer/lsD-rsch/blob/main/README.md#lisusd-price-stability) (minor, maybe only need to talk about and don't need dedicated slide)
- Liquidity staking and restaking: [click me](https://github.com/lacklusterer/lsD-rsch/blob/main/README.md#liquid-staking-tokens-lsts) 
- AMO: [official docs](https://docs.bsc.lista.org/introduction/collateral-debt-position/lisusd/algorithmic-market-operations-amo) 
## quit yapping and tell me why already

- over-collateralized stable coin and liquidity staking are successful model
tried-and-true by MakerDAO:
	* increased capital efficiency: Capital are not "dead/frozen" once put down
	and still can be utilized in other DeFi protocols to maximize yield
	* mechanisms to ensure the health of the pool, liquidity and stability
		+ destable coin, liquidation in dutch auction
