# LISTA - unorganized notes

- MakerDAO model, on BNB
- **Li**quidity **sta**king + colateralized debt position on BNB
- dual token: `LISTA` (governance and reward) + `lisUSD`
- POS reward + yield-bearing assets

## destable coin
- "decentralized stable coin"
- over colateralized with decentralized assets and liquidity-staked assets
- "broadly stable" instead of absolute, backed or algorithmic , similar to
normal fiat

## lisUSD price stability
- fiat peg =/= stability because fiat also fluctuate in value
- organic, "traditional" price stabilization:
- lisUSD > $1: need more supply:
	- borrowers borrow more to sell for arbitrage
	- decrease lisUSD borrow interest -> less farming reward -> less farm demand
- lisUSD < $1: need less supply:
	- borrowers buy cheap from market to pay debt
	- increase interest -> more farming reward -> less borrowing demand

## Stable coin trilemma:
decentralization, price stability, or capital efficiency

## tokenomics
- **lisUSD**: minted when user deposit collateral into CeVault (lista' colateral vault) -> lisUSD enters circulation
	- also obtained by buying from brokers/exchanges or staking lisUSD
- **LISTA**: ultility token, represent governance and ultility functions
	- payment / settlement within Lista DAO between participants
	- locked to receive veLISTA -> governance
